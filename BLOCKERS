This file documents known issues that must be addressed before
sandstorm-next should be relied upon.

Absolute blockers:

- [ ] Address all FIXME comments in the source code.
- [ ] Load a seccomp-bpf filter in the sandbox launcher.
- [ ] Set max file limits in sandbox setup (setrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, ...)).
- [ ] Do some verification that sandbox-launcher actually
      properly drops privileges; right now this isn't well tested.
- [ ] Do actual filtering of http traffic, rather than just passing everything through.
- [ ] Memory limits on capnp connections
  - [ ] from the outside
  - [ ] from apps
- [ ] Audit session implementation
  - [ ] Sanity check cookies have proper attributes/aren't visible from js etc.

Things that really *should* be dealt with, but aren't regressions from
sandstorm-legacy:

- [ ] Performance isolation with cgroups
