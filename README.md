Go Wrappers for Sandstorm's API

Right now just the output of go-capnpc for both the stuff that ships
with capnproto and all of the sandstorm schemas.

Right now this contains:

* `capnp`, generated packages for the sandstorm API capnproto schema.
  The packages are currently generated from the schema in sandstorm
  v0.97
* `websession`, a *very* WIP set of helpers around WebSession, most
  notably code to glue it to `net/http`.

Since the schema names are not all legal package names, the following
changes have been made:

* Schema with dashes in their names have had the dashes removed.
* The schema `package` has been mapped to the package `spk` (since
  `package` is a go reserved word).

This depends on a change to `zombiezen.com/go/capnproto2` that at the
time of writing has not been merged:

<https://github.com/zombiezen/go-capnproto2/pull/31>

To build these packages you will have to manually check out that branch
on my fork and put it in the appropriate place in `$GOPATH`.

# Licensing

Everything is licensed under the MIT license (Both my work and that of
upstream). The `*.capnp` files are the output of `gen.py`, which just
copies them from upstream and appends the lines beginning with `$Go`.
The copyright notices have been retained. The `*.capnp.go` files are
generated by `go-capnpc`, and should be thought of as object code; they
are committed to the repository to make the library usable with `go
get`.
