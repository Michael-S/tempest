Go Wrappers for Sandstorm's API

Right now just the output of go-capnpc for both the stuff that ships
with capnproto and all of the sandstorm schemas.

* `capnp/capnp` contains the base capnproto schema
* `capnp/sandstorm` contains the sandstorm APIs.

# Licensing

Everything is licensed under the MIT license (Both my work and that of
upstream). The `*.capnp` files are the output of `gen.py`, which just
copies them from upstream and appends the lines beginning with `$Go`.
The copyright notices have been retained. The `*.capnp.go` files are
generated by `go-capnpc`, and should be thought of as object code; they
are committed to the repository to make the library usable with `go
get`.
